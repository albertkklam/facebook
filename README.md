## Overview
The goal of this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-v-predicting-check-ins) is to predict which place a person would like to check in to. Facebook created an artificial world consisting of more than 100,000 places located in a 10 km by 10 km square. For a given set of coordinates, the task is to return a ranked list of the most likely places. Data was fabricated to resemble location signals coming from mobile devices, giving you a flavor of what it takes to work with real data complicated by inaccurate and noisy values. Inconsistent and erroneous location data can disrupt experience for services like Facebook Check In.

## Approach
Various approaches in Python and R have been discussed at length [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-v-predicting-check-ins/kernels). The purpose of this repository is to implement a solution in Apache Spark and its various libraries. I've chosen to use [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/), which provides good interactive features for data exploration.

> Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more.
